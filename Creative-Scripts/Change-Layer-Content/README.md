# Change Layer Content

## Description

“Change Layer Content” is a special effects script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript lets you change the content of the currently selected layer (fill layer or adjustment layer), preserving any associated masks and styles.

It is somehow a replacement for a similar feature which used to be available in Photoshop’s Layer menu; unfortunately, it got dropped from version CS4…

It is especially useful for editing images created with the script [Poster Effect Gallery](/Creative-Scripts/Poster-Effect-Gallery).

**Warning**: unfortunately, changing the content of a fill layer may be impossible in most recent versions of Photoshop (CC).

## Requirements

This script can be used in Adobe Photoshop CS or later. It has been successfully tested in CS and CS4 on Mac OS X, but should be platform agnostic.
