# Visualize Adjustment Layers

## Description

“Visualize Adjustment Layers” is a color ramps script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript allows you to create a specialized RGB document used to interactively visualize (as curves map, gradient map and color table) the effect of cumulated adjustment layers.

It is inspired by the impressive work done by Greg Apodaca, especially by the carefully crafted Photoshop files he has designed, called [Inspectors](http://www.gregapodaca.com/photoshopmechanics/inspectors/).

For more information about visualizing adjustment layers, please refer to: [007 Adjustment Layer Inspector | Adjustment Layers](http://www.gregapodaca.com/photoshopmechanics/files/007.html), part of the video tutorials available on [Photoshop Mechanics](http://www.gregapodaca.com/photoshopmechanics/).
