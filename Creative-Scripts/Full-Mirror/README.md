# Full Mirror

## Description

“Full Mirror” is a mirror effects script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript applies a “full-size” symmetry effect on an existing image, including possible transparency. The original image is not modified.

Select the “anchor” part of the effect by clicking on the appropriate button (Top, Right, Bottom, Left, or Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Right, Bottom Left).
