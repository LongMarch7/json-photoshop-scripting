# Insert Custom Shape Path

Description

“Insert Custom Shape Path” is a custom shapes files utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library, and more specifically its module `jamShapes`.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript is used to create a work path from a custom shape contained in a Photoshop custom shapes file (.csh).

Please refer to the [Photoshop Custom Shapes File Format](/Documentation/Photoshop-Custom-Shapes-File-Format) page for detailed information about the structure of a custom shapes file.
