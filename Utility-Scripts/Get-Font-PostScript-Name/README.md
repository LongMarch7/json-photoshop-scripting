# Get Font PostScript Name

## Description

“Get Font PostScript Name” is a fonts utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript opens a dialog box with two popup menus and a text field; use the left menu to select the font family and the right menu to select the font style, then get the font PostScript name from the bottom text field (read-only).

Font family and style are presented in the same way they are displayed in the character palette or in the type tool bar.
