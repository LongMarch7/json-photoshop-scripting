# Get Current Gradient

## Description

“Get Current Gradient” is a gradients utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript opens a dialog box with a text field containing the JSON simplified format of the current gradient, making use of the JSON Action Manager scripting library; you can copy and/or save the generated text in [Gradient Object Simplified Format](/JSON-Simplified-Formats/Gradient-Object-Simplified-Format) and use it in your own scripts by passing it to the function `jamHelpers.toGradientObject`.
