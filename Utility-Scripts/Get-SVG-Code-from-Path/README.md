# Get SVG Code from Path

## Description

“Get SVG Code from Path” is a paths utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript allows you to get SVG code from any currently selected path in the Paths palette. It opens a dialog box with a text field containing the SVG code of the path; you can copy and/or save the generated SVG text.

The script displays SVG code in the same format than the SVG files generated by the script [Convert Custom Shapes File to SVG Set](/Utility-Scripts/Convert-Custom-Shapes-File-to-SVG-Set). In fact, it makes use of a temporary custom shapes file containing only one shape defined from the current path.
