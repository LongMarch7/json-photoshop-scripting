# Get Path Components

## Description

“Get Path Components” is a paths utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript opens a dialog box with a text field containing the JSON simplified format of the components of the currently selected path, making use of the JSON Action Manager scripting library; you can copy and/or save the generated text in [Path Component List Simplified Format](/JSON-Simplified-Formats/Path-Component-List-Simplified-Format) and use it in your own scripts by passing it to the function `jamHelpers.toPathComponentList`.
