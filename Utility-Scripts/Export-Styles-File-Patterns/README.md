# Export Styles File Patterns

## Description

“Export Styles File Patterns” is a layer styles utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library, and more specifically its module `jamStyles`.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript is used to export the embedded patterns of a Photoshop styles file (.asl) or a styles palette (Styles.psp) into a new Photoshop patterns file.

The export patterns feature is also directly available from the script [Get Layer Style](/Utility-Scripts/Get-Layer-Style).

## Requirements

This script can be used in Adobe Photoshop CS3 or later. It has been successfully tested in CS4 on Mac OS X, but should be platform agnostic.
