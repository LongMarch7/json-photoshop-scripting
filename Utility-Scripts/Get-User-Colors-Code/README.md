# Get User Colors Code

## Description

“Get User Colors Code” is a code utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript opens a dialog box with a text field containing the code used to set user colors to the current foreground and background values, making use of the JSON Action Manager scripting library; you can copy any part of the code, in particular the color data in [Color Object Simplified Format](/JSON-Simplified-Formats/Color-Object-Simplified-Format) expected by the function `jamHelpers.toColorObject`.
