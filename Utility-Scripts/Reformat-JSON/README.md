# Reformat JSON

## Description

“Reformat JSON” is a JSON utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript opens a resizeable dialog box with one text area; copy or type any JSON code in it, then click the Reformat button to get it formatted. Basic editing support is provided, i.e., tabulations and new lines can be inserted.
