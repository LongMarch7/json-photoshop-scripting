# Play Actions File Action

## Description

“Play Actions File Action” is an actions files utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library, and more specifically its module `jamActions`.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript is used to play a specific action contained in a Photoshop actions file (.atn), without the need to load the file in the Actions Palette.

Please refer to the [Photoshop Actions File Format](/Documentation/actions-file-format.html) document for detailed information about the structure of an actions file.
