# Convert Actions File

## Description

“Convert Actions File” is an actions files utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library, and more specifically its module `jamActions`.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript is used to convert a Photoshop actions file (.atn) into a folder of directly executable scripts (.js) which can be further edited; they are made up of sequential calls to the function `jamEngine.jsonPlay`.

Please refer to the [Photoshop Actions File Format](/Documentation/Photoshop-Actions-File-Format) page for detailed information about the structure of an actions file.
