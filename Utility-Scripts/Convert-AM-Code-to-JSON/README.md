# Convert AM Code to JSON

## Description

“Convert AM Code to JSON” is a code utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript opens a resizeable dialog box with two text areas; in the first field, copy any Action Manager code obtained from the ScriptingListenerJS.log file, then click the Convert button to get it translated into executable JSON Action Manager calls in the second field. Basic editing support is provided, i.e., tabulations and new lines can be inserted.
