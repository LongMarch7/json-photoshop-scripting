# List Recent Files

## Description

“List Recent Files” is a miscellaneous utility script using the [JSON Action Manager](/JSON-Action-Manager) scripting library.

This stand-alone script written in JavaScript opens a dialog box with a text field containing a JSON object listing the full paths of all the recently opened files in Photoshop (same as File>Open Recent). You can copy or save the generated JSON text.
