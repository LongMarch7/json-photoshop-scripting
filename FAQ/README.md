Answers to Frequently Asked Questions:

## What is JSON?

JSON (pronounced like the English given name *Jason*), which stands for “JavaScript Object Notation”, is a lightweight computer data interchange format.

JSON is a subset of the object literal notation of JavaScript, but its use does not require JavaScript. It is a general-purpose, text-based, open standard designed for human-readable data interchange.

JSON’s simplicity has resulted in its widespread use, especially in the development of web applications.

Despite its relationship to JavaScript, JSON is language-independent, with parsers available for many languages. In JavaScript, JSON can be parsed trivially using the `eval()` function.

JSON is now a formal international data processing standard (October 2013).

## How to install a script?

Download the Zip file and unzip it.

Move the script to the `Presets/Scripts` folder in the default preset location of the Adobe Photoshop application. On next launch, the script will appear in the `File > Automate` submenu.

Scripts added to the `Scripts` folder while Photoshop is running will not appear in the menu until the next time you launch the application.

Also: the Browse item at the end of the Scripts menu (`File > Scripts > Browse`) allows you to execute scripts which are not installed in the `Scripts` folder. You can also use Browse to select scripts installed in the `Scripts` folder after the application was last launched.
